      Save the Children has a robust presence in as many as 16 states of India. Our projects and interventions are designed to improve the lives of underprivileged children by helping them get access to quality education, healthcare services and nutrition and keeping them out of harm’s way. We also work to equip children and their communities to be resilient in the face of emergency situations. Whenever disasters strike, we’re among the first respondents and mobilise life-saving humanitarian aid for children and their communities.
